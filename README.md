# People Analytics: Workforce Mental Health Risk and Performance Impact

## Overview
This project analyzes whether work environment (remote, hybrid, on-site) or demographic factors (age, gender) have stronger associations with employee mental health risk and productivity outcomes.

The goal is to determine whether work environment changes meaningfully influence well-being or whether intervention strategies should focus on demographic or mental health risk-based segmentation instead.

## The Business Problem
The primary question that needs to be answered is: how do different work environments influence mental heatlh risk and well-being indicators among employees?

To answer this question, I broke down the problem into smaller analytical questions:

- Does work environment influence mental health risk distribution?

- How is high stress distributed across environments?

- Does productivity vary by work environment?

- Does age explain greater variation in risk concentration?

- Does gender influence mental health risk levels?

- Is productivity more strongly associated with demographic factors or risk status?

## Executive Findings

Key Findings:

1. Work environment shows a small variation in risk distribution (3pp difference).
2. High stress concentration varies <2pp across environments.
3. Age demonstrates a greater differentiation (5–7pp range).
4. Mid-career employees (age 36–55) show higher stress concentration.
5. Gender differences exist but are minimal (4.6pp difference).
6. Productivity decline aligns strongly with mental health risk level, not work environment.

## Business Recommendation

The analysis suggests that work environment changes alone are unlikely to reduce mental health risk.

Organizations should prioritize early risk identification, stress management initiatives, and target mid-career support rather than relying solely on remote or hybrid policy adjustments.
Mental health risk status is the strongest predictor of performance metrics and should be used to understand employees and meet their needs.
