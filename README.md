# Employee Wellness & Mental Health Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes whether work environment (remote, hybrid, on-site) or demographic factors (age, gender) have stronger associations with employee mental health risk and productivity outcomes.

The goal is to determine whether work environment changes meaningfully influence well-being or whether intervention strategies should focus on demographic or mental health risk-based segmentation instead.

## The Business Problem
The primary question that needs to be answered is: how do different work environments influence mental heatlh risk and well-being indicators among employees?

To answer this question, I broke down the problem into smaller analytical questions:

- Does work environment influence mental health risk distribution?

- How is high stress distributed across environments?

- Does productivity vary by work environment?

- Does age explain greater variation in risk concentration?

- Does gender influence mental health risk levels?

- Is productivity more strongly associated with demographic factors or risk status?

## Executive Findings

Key Findings:

1. Work environment shows a small variation in risk distribution (3pp difference).
2. High stress concentration varies <2pp across environments.
3. Age demonstrates a greater differentiation (5–7pp range).
4. Mid-career employees (36–55) show higher stress concentration.
5. Gender differences exist but are minimal (4.6pp difference).
6. Productivity decline aligns strongly with mental health risk level, not work environment.

## Business Recommendation

The analysis suggests that work environment changes alone are unlikely to reduce mental health risk.

Organizations should prioritize early risk identification, stress management initiatives, and targeted mid-career support rather than relying solely on remote or hybrid policy adjustments.
Mental health risk status is the strongest predictor of performance metrics.
