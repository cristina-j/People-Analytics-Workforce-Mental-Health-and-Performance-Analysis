# Employee Wellness & Mental Health Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between employee mental health and workplace environment using survey-based data. The goal of the analysis is to better understand how different workplace factors influence mental health outcomes and whether there is a correlation between where an individual works (n-site, hybrid, or remote) and their mental health risk.

## The Business Problem
The primary question that needs to be answered is: how do different work environments influence mental heatlh risk and well-being indicators among employees?

To answer this question, I broke down the problem into smaller analytical questions:

- Which work environment has the highest proportions of high-risk employees?
- Do stress, sleep, anxiety, and depression levels differ across work enviornments?
- Is one type of work environment associated with better productivity?
- Which well-being factors are most associated with high, medium, and low mental health risk categories?

## How the data was collected
The data was collected from a Kaggle dataset which explores the relationship between workplace conditions and employee mental heatlh. The creator notes that the dataset was designed to analyze how factors such as stress, depression, productivity, anxiety, and sleep vary across different work environments which includes remote, hybrid, and on-site settings. The dataset includes individual self-reported metrics and a classified mental health risk level (Low, Medium, High), allowing for meaningful exploration of how workplace structure may influence an individuals overall well-being.

## Methodology
I began the analysis by exploring the dataset in Excel to familiarize myself with the structure of the data, review each column, and identify what kinds of questions the dataset could answer. This initial exploration helped me understand the distribution of key attributes such as stress, depression, anxiety, sleep hours, and work environment, and then guided the development of meaningful sub-questions that support the overall business question. 

Since the dataset from Kaggle was already clean, minimal cleaning was required. After reviewing the data, I imported the CSV file into SQL, where I conducted the majority of the analysis, wrote queries to calculate averages, counts, and percentages, and examined how workplace conditions affect mental health risk and employee well-being.
